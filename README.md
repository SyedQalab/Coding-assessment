# Assessment Solution

This project contains solutions to two challenges: the "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and the "Refactoring" challenge. Both challenges are completed within the same folder.

## Challenges

### Ticket Breakdown

The "Ticket Breakdown" challenge involves generating reports for client Facilities, providing information on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter. The challenge requires modifying the existing system to allow Facilities to save custom IDs for Agents when generating reports.

For more details, refer to the [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md) file.

### Refactoring

The "Refactoring" challenge focuses on refactoring the `deterministicPartitionKey` function in the `dpk.js` file. The goal is to improve the readability and maintainability of the code without altering its functionality.

For more details, refer to the [Refactoring](Refactoring.md) file.
